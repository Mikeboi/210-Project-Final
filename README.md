# Electrical engineering 210 Final project
This project is a simulation of Pong made to run on the BuckyBoard (UW-Madison's Begining Circuit board).
In order to run it you would need the affiliated board and Tiva series C Launchpad by Nspire. 
However, if you would like to see a demo, you can find visit the video demonstration through the link :

The code itself is inside the zip file, you can download it to view the contents in any IDE that opens C files/ H files (from C). All dependencies are included in the zip.

While the API and peripherals are coded in a more rigorous class, the code written by myself (with bitmaps codded by Brett Maulhum) can be found in the ECE210 Folder as well as a readme file on how the code works in more detail.
